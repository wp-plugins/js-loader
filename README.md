# js_loader
JS Loader is a WordPress plugin to easily add jQuery and JavaScript files. In the future, it meant to be the gateway of all jQuery and JavaScript functionality.

This is an updated version of JS Loader, we remove support for the hardcoded array for JS Libraries. Instead, we uses JSON data format and uses url from CDNJS to get the libraries.
